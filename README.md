# Professional Portfolio for Rodrigo Gambra

>For details on how to build a professional portfolio like this, please see [Techfolio's website](https://techfolios.github.io).


This repository contains the pages detailing my Resume, Projects, and blog articles that would give an idea of my experience as a software developer so far.

You are welcome to use it as a starting point to __build your own Portfolio__, but I most definitely ***DO NOT ALLOW YOU USING MY PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL INFORMATION IN ANY WAY***. This restriction applies both offline and online, for the following elements:

* **Resume**
* **Profile picture**
* **Projects' text and pictures**
* **Favicon file**

On the other hand, you may be allowed to reuse my Blog articles (Refered to as _Essays_ in the website) depending on the Creative Commons Licence specified in each document.

For anything else, refer to the appropriate licence that each software author may have deemed suitable. I claim NO ownership of any code not written by me. However, Techfolios has licenced the template under the MIT Licence and, to the extent of my knowledge, the libraries used to build these template are licenced under Open Source licences.
